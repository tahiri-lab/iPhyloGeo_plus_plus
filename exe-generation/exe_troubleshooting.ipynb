    "### September 18, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generated an EXE of the project with Pyinstaller\n",
    "2. Got **ModuleNotFoundError** on this line in main.py: `import qtmodern.styles`\n",
    "3. Created a hooks directory within scripts\n",
    "4. Created hooks\\hook-qtmodern.py (file contents in code snippets below)\n",
    "5. Added qtmodern and PyQt5 to the Poetry venv (PyQt5 was a mistake as the project actually uses PyQt6; I fixed that later)\n",
    "6. Updated main.spec to collect data files for qtmodern and PyQt5\n",
    "7. Specified \"qtmoderns\" as an hidden import in main.spec\n",
    "8. Removed and added qtmodern to the Poetry venv\n",
    "10. Asked [a question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79767848/exe-created-with-pyinstaller-fails-to-import-qtmodern-as-specified-in-hook) on StackOverflow to get outside input\n",
    "11. Got the virtual environment’s path and stored it in a variable called $venvpath in Powershell\n",
    "12. Generated an EXE using main.py rather than main.spec (this makes Pyinstaller overwrite the main.spec file), with command `poetry run pyinstaller main.py --onefile --paths \"$venvPath\\Lib\\site-packages\"  --hidden-import=qtmodern  --hidden-import=qtmodern.styles --hidden-import=qtmodern.windows`\n",
    "13. Got **ModuleNotFoundError** three lines further than before in main.py: `from event_connector import QtEvents, connect_decorated_methods, connect_event`\n",
    "14. Since event_connector.py was located in scripts with main.py, added an empty __init__.py file to scripts\n",
    "15. Edited main.spec to add event_connector to hiddenimports and \".\" to pathex\n",
    "16. Pyinstaller **would no longer generate an EXE** file at all. Replaced \".\" in main.spec’s pathex with the full path on my machine\n",
    "17. Ran `poetry remove PyQt5` and `poetry add PyQt6`\n",
    "18. There were **traces of PyQt5 remaining**\n",
    "19. Deleted the venv and recreated it with command `Invoke-Expression (poetry env activate)` (Powershell-specific syntax)\n",
    "20. Now able to generate an EXE and run it, got the **ModuleNotFoundError** on the qtmodern import again\n",
    "21. Removed the active folder from main.spec’s pathex after an online search showed me that Pyinstaller doesn’t handle multiple elements in the pathex list well\n",
    "22. Ran `poetry remove qtmodern` and `poetry add qtmodern`\n",
    "23. Pyinstaller gave this **error message** while trying to generate an EXE: `Aborting build process due to attempt to collect multiple Qt bindings packages: attempting to run hook for 'PySide6', while hook for 'PyQt6' has already been run!`\n",
    "24. Added `excludes['PySide6'],` to  main.spec\n",
    "25. Now able to generate an EXE and run it, got this error: `ImportError: Error importing numpy: you should not try to import numpy from its source directory; please exit the numpy source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter from there.`\n",
    "26. Added `collect_data_files(\"numpy\")` to datas in main.spec\n",
    "27. Got a **ValueError** when trying to generate the EXE: `too many values to unpack (expected 2)`\n",
    "28. Tried to create a function that would flatten the input and put it into two lists and pass that to datas\n",
    "29. Emptied datas\n",
    "30. Learned from an online search that there is a known issue when using Numpy 1.27 with 3.12 in a frozen environment\n",
    "31. Downloaded, installed and added Python 3.11 to the venv\n",
    "32. When running the EXE generated with Python 3.11, I get a **PyQt error**: `qtpy.QtBindingsNotFoundError: No Qt bindings could be found` from the `import qtmodern.styles` line in main.py\n",
    "33. Tried to include everything that seemed relevant in hiddenimports (see code snippets below)\n",
    "34. Created `hooks/hook-qtpy.py` (file contents in code snippets below)\n",
    "35. Added the line `os.environ[\"QT_API\"] = \"pyqt6\"` to main.py``\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Provided ChatGPT with the troubleshooting steps from September 18 and asked it for ideas\n",
    "2. Ran `poetry run python -c \"import qtpy; import PyQt6; print(qtpy.API_NAME)\"`, confirming PyQt6 is set up properly inside the venv\n",
    "3. Replaced the contents of hook-qtpy with those suggested by ChatGPT (see code snippets below)\n",
    "4. Replaced the contents of hook.qtmodern with those suggested by ChatGPT (see code snippets below)\n",
    "5. Added \"qtpy\",  \"qtpy\",  \"qtpy.QtCore\"   \"qtpy.QtGu and    \"qtpy.QtWidge s\",to main.spec’s hiddenimpo\n",
    "6. Added the lines `from PyInstaller.utils.hooks import collect_dynamic_libs` and `binaries = collect_dynamic_libs(\"PyQt6\")` to main.spec, and added the binaries variable to the binaries list\n",
    "7. Got a **ValueError** when trying to generate the EXE: `not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)`\n",
    "8. Renamed main.spec to main.spec.old to replace it by a new version yet be able to consult the old version (see new version in code snippets below)\n",
    "9. Added the venv path to the new main.spec and event_connector to its hiddenimports\n",
    "10. An EXE does get generated; encountering the **PyQt error** again when running it\n",
    "11. Using Powershell in scripts\\dist, ran `pyi-archive_viewer main.exe` but **pyi-archive_viewer** wasn’t recognized as a command, despite Pyinstaller being recognized in the same folder `The term 'pyi-archive-_viewer' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.`\n",
    "12. Searched my AppData folder for pyi-archive_viewer and found the path to it\n",
    "13. Using Powershell in scripts\\dist, ran `thepathIfound\\pyi-archive_viewer.exe main.exe` and verified that PyQt6 was bundled\r",
    "14. Did more research and found [a page from Qt for Python’s documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6.5/deployment/deployment-pyinstaller.html) indicating that \"As of March 2021, Qt 6 is not supported yet. PyInstaller is unable to properly deploy Qt; the Qt plugins are not copied. With that, using `--onefile` is not possible.\" As PyQt6 is a set of bindings for Qt 6 so this may force us to use another tool than Pyinstaller. For now, I have decided to look into not using onefile. This means more than just the EXE will be generated, but I figure that we could create a MSI that saves all the other required files to the same folder.\n",
    "15. Deleted the scripts\\dist folder\n",
    "16. Ran `poetry run pyinstaller main.py --clean` to generate a new .spec file and EXE\n",
    "17. Edited the new spec file to add the venv’s path to pathex, all the hiddenimports from the previous version of the file and \"PySide6\" to excludes\n",
    "18. Got the **qtpy** error again\n",
