    "\n",
    "### September 18, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generated an EXE of the project with Pyinstaller\n",
    "2. Got **ModuleNotFoundError** on this line in main.py: `import qtmodern.styles`\n",
    "3. Created a hooks directory within scripts\n",
    "4. Created hooks\\hook-qtmodern.py (file contents in code snippets below)\n",
    "5. Added qtmodern and PyQt5 to the Poetry venv (PyQt5 was a mistake as the project actually uses PyQt6; I fixed that later)\n",
    "6. Updated main.spec to collect data files for qtmodern and PyQt5\n",
    "7. Specified \"qtmoderns\" as an hidden import in main.spec\n",
    "8. Removed and added qtmodern to the Poetry venv\n",
    "10. Asked [a question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79767848/exe-created-with-pyinstaller-fails-to-import-qtmodern-as-specified-in-hook) on StackOverflow to get outside input\n",
    "11. Got the virtual environment’s path and stored it in a variable called $venvpath in Powershell\n",
    "12. Generated an EXE using main.py rather than main.spec (this makes Pyinstaller overwrite the main.spec file), with command `poetry run pyinstaller main.py --onefile --paths \"$venvPath\\Lib\\site-packages\"  --hidden-import=qtmodern  --hidden-import=qtmodern.styles --hidden-import=qtmodern.windows`\n",
    "13. Got **ModuleNotFoundError** three lines further than before in main.py: `from event_connector import QtEvents, connect_decorated_methods, connect_event`\n",
    "14. Since event_connector.py was located in scripts with main.py, added an empty __init__.py file to scripts\n",
    "15. Edited main.spec to add event_connector to hiddenimports and \".\" to pathex\n",
    "16. Pyinstaller **would no longer generate an EXE** file at all. Replaced \".\" in main.spec’s pathex with the full path on my machine\n",
    "17. Ran `poetry remove PyQt5` and `poetry add PyQt6`\n",
    "18. There were **traces of PyQt5 remaining**\n",
    "19. Deleted the venv and recreated it with command `Invoke-Expression (poetry env activate)` (Powershell-specific syntax)\n",
    "20. Now able to generate an EXE and run it, got the **ModuleNotFoundError** on the qtmodern import again\n",
    "21. Removed the active folder from main.spec’s pathex after an online search showed me that Pyinstaller doesn’t handle multiple elements in the pathex list well\n",
    "22. Ran `poetry remove qtmodern` and `poetry add qtmodern`\n",
    "23. Pyinstaller gave this **error message** while trying to generate an EXE: `Aborting build process due to attempt to collect multiple Qt bindings packages: attempting to run hook for 'PySide6', while hook for 'PyQt6' has already been run!`\n",
    "24. Added `excludes['PySide6'],` to  main.spec\n",
    "25. Now able to generate an EXE and run it, got this error: `ImportError: Error importing numpy: you should not try to import numpy from its source directory; please exit the numpy source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter from there.`\n",
    "26. Added `collect_data_files(\"numpy\")` to datas in main.spec\n",
    "27. Got a **ValueError** when trying to generate the EXE: `too many values to unpack (expected 2)`\n",
    "28. Tried to create a function that would flatten the input and put it into two lists and pass that to datas\n",
    "29. Emptied datas\n",
    "30. Learned from an online search that there is a known issue when using Numpy 1.27 with 3.12 in a frozen environment\n",
    "31. Downloaded, installed and added Python 3.11 to the venv\n",
    "32. When running the EXE generated with Python 3.11, I get a **PyQt error**: `qtpy.QtBindingsNotFoundError: No Qt bindings could be found` from the `import qtmodern.styles` line in main.py\n",
    "33. Tried to include everything that seemed relevant in hiddenimports (see code snippets below)\n",
    "34. Created `hooks/hook-qtpy.py` (file contents in code snippets below)\n",
    "35. Added the line `os.environ[\"QT_API\"] = \"pyqt6\"` to main.py"

    "### September 20, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provided ChatGPT with the troubleshooting steps from September 18 and asked it for ideas\n",
    "2. Ran `poetry run python -c \"import qtpy; import PyQt6; print(qtpy.API_NAME)\"`, confirming PyQt6 is set up properly inside the venv\n",
    "3. Replaced the contents of hook-qtpy with those suggested by ChatGPT (see code snippets below)\n",
    "4. Replaced the contents of hook.qtmodern with those suggested by ChatGPT (see code snippets below)\n",
    "5. Added \"qtpy\", \"qtpy\", \"qtpy.QtCore\", \"qtpy.QtGui\" and \"qtpy.QtWidgets\", to main.spec’s hiddenimports\n",
    "6. Added the lines `from PyInstaller.utils.hooks import collect_dynamic_libs` and `binaries = collect_dynamic_libs(\"PyQt6\")` to main.spec, and added the binaries variable to the binaries list\n",
    "7. Got a **ValueError** when trying to generate the EXE: `not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)`\n",
    "8. Renamed main.spec to main.spec.old to replace it by a new version yet be able to consult the old version (see new version in code snippets below)\n",
    "9. Added the venv path to the new main.spec and event_connector to its hiddenimports\n",
    "10. An EXE does get generated; encountering the **PyQt error** again when running it\n",
    "11. Using Powershell in scripts\\dist, ran `pyi-archive_viewer main.exe` but **pyi-archive_viewer** wasn’t recognized as a command, despite Pyinstaller being recognized in the same folder `The term 'pyi-archive-_viewer' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.`\n",
    "12. Searched my AppData folder for pyi-archive_viewer and found the path to it\n",
    "13. Using Powershell in scripts\\dist, ran `thepathIfound\\pyi-archive_viewer.exe main.exe` and verified that PyQt6 was bundled\r",
    "14. Did more research and found [a page from Qt for Python’s documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6.5/deployment/deployment-pyinstaller.html) indicating that \"As of March 2021, Qt 6 is not supported yet. PyInstaller is unable to properly deploy Qt; the Qt plugins are not copied. With that, using `--onefile` is not possible.\" As PyQt6 is a set of bindings for Qt 6 so this may force us to use another tool than Pyinstaller. For now, I have decided to look into not using onefile. This means more than just the EXE will be generated, but I figure that we could create a MSI that saves all the other required files to the same folder.\n",
    "15. Deleted the scripts\\dist folder\n",
    "16. Ran `poetry run pyinstaller main.py --clean` to generate a new .spec file and EXE\n",
    "17. Edited the new spec file to add the venv’s path to pathex, all the hiddenimports from the previous version of the file and \"PySide6\" to excludes\n",
    "18. Got the **qtpy** error again"

    "### September 22, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provided ChatGPT with the troubleshooting steps from the two previous troubleshooting sessions and asked it for ideas\n",
    "2. Added 3 lines of code to main.spec to collect submodules for \"qtpy\" and \"PyQt6\" as well as data files for \"PyQt6\" (see code snippets). I did not collect the dynamic libs as I found previously that it would lead to a ValueError (see September 20th’s step 7)\n",
    "3. Added the collected submodules and data files to the Analysis in main.spec\n",
    "4. Got the same **ValueError** as before when trying to generate the EXE: `not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)`\n",
    "5. Removed the datas variable from main.spec\n",
    "6. The EXE is generated but when run it throws the **qtpy.QtBindingsNotFoundError** again\n",
    "7. Researched QtPy’s Python 3.11 compatibility and [it should work](https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/) (with pip, not conda)\n",
    "8. Ran `Invoke-Expression (poetry env activate)` on Powershell to use command line from the virtual environment, then ran `pip install qtpy`. It confirmed it was already installed\n",
    "9. Asked [a question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79771969/encountering-qtpy-qtbindingsnotfounderror-when-running-an-exe-generated-by-pyins]) on StackOverflow in the hope of finding a fix\n",
    "10. Tried to build a new EXE without changing anything (to my knowledge) and now there is a new error: `ERROR: Unable to find 'path_on_my_machine\\\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Packages\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\\\LocalCache\\local-packages\\Python312\\site-packages\\\\PyQt6\\\\__init__.py' when adding binary and data files.` I would have expected it to look into \n",
    "11. Tried the build again, same error\n",
    "12. Looked up what should be the actual path to the venv, `path_on_my_machine\\iPhyloGeo_plus_plus\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\PyQt6\\Qt6\\translations` and it does have a qtwebengine_locales directory, which contains many .pak files. There is only one element in main.spec’s pathex and it is the site-packages folder from the virtual environment.\n",
    "13. Modified the pyinstaller_build.bat file to set QTWEBENGINE_LOCALES_PATH to the appropriate path before running pyinstaller\n",
    "14. Created a new file in scripts: test.py, which imports PyQt6 and then prints `PyQt6.__file__` (see code snippets)\n",
    "15. In Powershell, ran `python test.py`. It printed `path_on_my_machine\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\LocalCache\\local-packages\\Python312\\site-packages\\PyQt6\\__init__.py`\n",
    "16. Ran `Invoke-Expression (poetry env activate)`, then `python test.py`. It showed the proper path, the one from the virtual environment.\n",
    "17. From the scripts folder, ran `poetry remove PyQt6`. It said `The following packages were not found: PyQt6`.\n",
    "18. Ran `poetry add PyQt6`\n",
    "19. Went back to Powershell. Ran `poetry run python test.py' and it gave the correct path, within the .venv folder\n",
    "20. Tried `poetry run pyinstaller test.py` and not only did it generate an EXE, but the EXE works, printing `path_on_my_machine\\iPhyloGeo_plus_plus\\scripts\\dist\\test\\_internal\\PyQt6\\__init__.py`\n",
    "21. Decided to go from the start again. Ran `poetry run pyinstaller main.py --clean`. An EXE was generated. It threw a ModuleNotFoundError when ran due to not finding qtmodern.\n",
    "22. Added the path to the proper site-packages folder to main.spec’s pathex\n",
    "23. Trying to generate the EXE failed as it was looking for the qtwebengine_locales folder in the wrong place again.\n",
    "24. Added the following to main.spec’s hiddenimports list: \"qtpy\", \"qtpy.QtCore\", \"qtpy.QtGui\", \"qtpy.QtWidgets\", \t\"PyQt6.QtCore\", \"PyQt6.QtGui\", \"PyQt6.QtWidgets\" \n",
    "\t\"PyQt6.QtPrintSupport\", \"PyQt6.QtSvg\", \"PyQt6.QtOpenG\n",
    "25. Read the log from Pyinstaller and there is an entry titled `425 INFO: Module search paths (PYTHONPATH)`.  The .venv\\Lib\\site-packages’s full path is listed.\n",
    "26. Edited test.py to replace `import PyQt6` by `from PyQt6 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets`, mimicking main.py, then print `QtCore.__file__`\n",
    "27. Ran `poetry run python test.py` and it correctly pointed to the virtual environment\n",
    "28. Edited test.py again to import much more (see code snippets\n",
    "29. Got the following warning when running `poetry run python test.py`: `path_on_my_machine\\iPhyloGeo_plus_plus\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\Bio\\Application\\__init__.py:39: BiopythonDeprecationWarning: The Bio.Application modules and modules relying on it have been deprecated.` Then it printed the correct path, pointing to the virtual environment again. \n",
    "30. Copied all the imports from the beginning of main.py to test.py and tested again. The EXE did get generated but then failed with a **ModuleNotFoundError**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt6.QtWebEngineWidgets'.\n",
    "31. Added \"qtpy\", \"qtpy.QtCore\", \"qtpy.QtGui\", \"qtpy.QtWidgets\", \t\"PyQt6.QtCore\", \"PyQt6.QtGui\", \"PyQt6.QtWidgets\" \n",
    "\t\"PyQt6.QtPrintSupport\", \"PyQt6.QtSv and\", \"PyQt6.QtOpenG to test.spec’s hiddenimports\n",
    "32. Ran `poetry run python test.py` and it correctly pointed to the virtual environment\n",
    "33. Added \"PyQt6.QtWebEngineWidgets\" to test.spec’s hiddenimports\n",
    "34. Commented out the PyQt6.WebEngineWidgets import from test.py since it threw an error at runtime and I’m currently trying to troubleshoot EXE generation\n",
    "35. Got another **ModuleNotFoundError**, this time with qtmodern\n",
    "36. Added \"qtmodern\", \"qtmodern.styles\" and \"qtmodern.windows\" to test.spec’s hiddenimports\n",
    "37. Ran `poetry remove qtmodern` and `poetry add qtmodern`\n",
    "38. Commented out the qtmodern imports from test.py since it threw an error at runtime and I’m currently trying to troubleshoot EXE generationL\"tCore.pydL\""
